UPLOADED TO STEAM WORKSHOP LAST AT 21 Jun, 2021 @ 6:39pm

HELLO THERE.

I was bored so here i am, creating a mod from scratch and to be honest i have no idea what i'm doing. BUT PLEASE BY ALL MEANS ENJOY.

Firstly the goal of this was more to add immersion than overhaul gameplay in anyway. That's why you may think the cost to upgrade the monuments is high. I don't want the AI or players to rely on any of the effects the monuments provide. The monuments or great works also have more generic ideas for 2 reasons. I want them to be generic and act like nice additions to the map and flavor rather than have fully fledged unique and balanced monuments. I leave that to paradox, and on that topic the second reason is that i did this by myself in 24h.

*full list of provinces with monuments at the end*

~~~~~This mod is eurocentric~~~~~

Normal monuments chosen from UNESCO Heritage sights and Wikipedia searches and forum threads
I have made a mod that adds a total of 10+ monuments to the game. These include:
Malbork Castle
The dome of Florance
The roman Colosseum
Hohenzollern Castle
The list goes on.

Universities that exist to this day founded before 1500's.
I have also added universities to the game as monuments. These include:
Oxford University
The University Of Bologna
The Jagiellonian University
Charles University
The list goes on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These monuments come with their own images and their own effects. (Though some have shared effects and universities all have the same ones.

Examples of effect monuments provide:

The House of Blackheads - Riga
Tier 1:
province_trade_power_modifier = 0.5
trade_efficiency = 0.05
mercantilism_cost = -0.1

Tier 2:
province_trade_power_modifier = 1
trade_efficiency = 0.10
mercantilism_cost = -0.15

tier 3:
province_trade_power_modifier = 2
trade_efficiency = 0.15
mercantilism_cost = -0.25

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All universities have generic effects, here are the generic events each university has:

Tier 1:
innovativeness_gain = 0.1
prestige = 0.25

Tier 2:
local_development_cost = -0.05
global_institution_spread = 0.05
innovativeness_gain = 0.25
prestige = 0.25
all_power_cost = -0.025

Tier 3:
local_development_cost = -0.10
global_institution_spread = 0.15
innovativeness_gain = 0.5
all_power_cost = -0.05
prestige = 1
